# Foundational Coding Lessons

A structured course for absolute beginners learning to code with TypeScript.

## 🎯 Course Structure

This repository is organized into lessons, with each lesson covering specific programming concepts. Each concept has its own file that can be run independently, allowing you to experiment and see results immediately.

## 📚 Lessons

### Lesson 1: TypeScript Basics
Learn the fundamental building blocks of programming:
- Print statements (console.log)
- Variables (let and const)
- If statements (conditional logic)
- For loops (counted repetition)
- While loops (conditional repetition)

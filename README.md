# Foundational Coding Lessons

A structured course for absolute beginners learning to code with TypeScript.

## 🎯 Course Structure

This repository is organized into lessons, with each lesson covering specific programming concepts. Each concept has its own file that can be run independently, allowing you to experiment and see results immediately.

## 📚 Lessons

### Lesson 0: Environment Setup
Get your MacBook ready for coding! This lesson walks you through installing everything you need:
- Homebrew (macOS package manager)
- Git (version control)
- Node.js and npm (JavaScript runtime and package manager)
- Visual Studio Code (code editor)
- VS Code extensions for TypeScript and React
- How to clone this repository and install dependencies

**Start here if you're setting up your computer for the first time!**

### Lesson 1: TypeScript Basics
Learn the fundamental building blocks of programming:
- Print statements (console.log)
- Variables (let and const)
- If statements (conditional logic)
- For loops (counted repetition)
- While loops (conditional repetition)

### Lesson 2: Introduction to React
Apply your TypeScript skills to build interactive web applications:
- Setting up a React project with Vite
- Using variables in React components
- Conditional rendering (if statements in React)
- Rendering lists (loops in React)
- Building your first web components

### Lesson 3: Understanding Types
Learn why types are important and how to use them effectively:
- What types are and why programs need them
- Understanding the difference between JavaScript and TypeScript
- Type annotations (explicitly declaring types)
- Type inference (how TypeScript figures out types automatically)
- Working with types in practical scenarios

**Already set up?** Make sure you have:
- Node.js installed on your computer
- A text editor (VS Code recommended)
- A terminal/command prompt
- Git installed

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash

```

Simply replace the filename with the one you want to run!

## 💡 How to Use This Course

1. **Read the lesson README** - Each lesson folder has instructions
2. **Run the example files** - See the code in action first
3. **Read the code comments** - They explain what's happening
4. **Complete the exercises** - Practice problems are at the end of each file
5. **Experiment** - Change things and see what happens!

## 🎓 Learning Tips

- **Don't rush** - Take time to understand each concept
- **Type the code yourself** - Don't just read it
- **Make mistakes** - Errors are part of learning
- **Ask questions** - If something isn't clear, seek help
- **Practice regularly** - Consistency is key

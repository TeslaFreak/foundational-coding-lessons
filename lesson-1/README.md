# Lesson 1: TypeScript Basics

Welcome to your first coding lesson! In this lesson, you'll learn the fundamental building blocks of programming using TypeScript.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Print Statements** - How to display output
2. **Variables** - How to store and use data
3. **If Statements** - How to make decisions in code
4. **For Loops** - How to repeat code a specific number of times
5. **While Loops** - How to repeat code based on conditions

## How to Run the Files

Each concept has its own file that you can run independently. To run a file, use this command:

```bash
npm run lesson lesson-1/01-print-statements.ts
```

Replace the filename with any of these:
- `01-print-statements.ts` - Learn about console.log()
- `02-variables.ts` - Learn about storing data
- `03-if-statements.ts` - Learn about making decisions
- `04-for-loops.ts` - Learn about counting loops
- `05-while-loops.ts` - Learn about conditional loops

## Tips for Learning

1. **Run the files first** - See what they do before making changes
2. **Read the comments** - They explain what each part does
3. **Try the exercises** - Each file has practice problems at the end
4. **Experiment** - Change values and see what happens!
5. **Make mistakes** - That's how we learn!

## Example

Try running your first program:

```bash
npm run lesson lesson-1/01-print-statements.ts
```

You should see various messages printed to the console. Now open the file, complete the exercises at the bottom, and run it again to see your changes!

## Getting Help

If you get an error, don't worry! Read the error message carefully - it usually tells you what went wrong and on which line. Common issues:
- **Syntax errors** - Check for missing semicolons, quotes, or brackets
- **Type errors** - Make sure you're using the right kind of data

Happy coding! 🚀
